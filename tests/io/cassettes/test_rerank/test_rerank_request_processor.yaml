      are a smart and helpful AI assistant with in-depth knowledge about how people
      search for information using search engines. In this task, you are given two
      passages, and a query, your job is to judge which passage is relatively more
      suitable to answer that query. The first passage will start with \\\"passage
      A\\\" and the second passage with start with \\\"passage B\\\". Output the preferred
      passage index, i.e. A or B and followed by an explanation, if none of the passage
      answer the query directly, pick the one that has more relevant information.\\n\\n
      passage A: If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.
      You would need to give the court notice in writing and tell them you want to
      make an oral argument. As long as you meet the deadline in the court\u2019s
      notice about oral argument, the court will almost always schedule time for your
      oral argument.\\n  \\n  Where can I get legal help?   Form APP-001 has full
      instructions on appeal procedures.\\nEach Court of Appeal has self-help resources
      online. You can also contact your local Court of Appeal to see if they have
      a self-help center at the court.\\nYou can also visit a law library to do legal

      - Details\\n\\nFriday, 22 March 2024\\n\\nDeep Impact/EPOXINSSDCA/COSPAR ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe
      goals of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and
      launch a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta,
      much of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet,
      the crater formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the
      nucleus, particularly the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of
      the mission are to: improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of
      cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine
      properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition
      from the crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface
      layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior
      by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact;
      and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during
      encounter. \\n             query: I need to do some legal research to be prepared

      \\n passage B: 6.\\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\\n\\r\\nThe
      San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground
      reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel
      Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \\\"spreading basins\\\".
      Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such
      as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of
      the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater.
      Thus, keeping our groundwater resource clean is vitally important to all of
      us. \\t\\n\\n7.\\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\\n\\r\\nMany products
      we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners,
      flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze.
      These products are not only hazardous to our health, but to our environment.
      By disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater
      contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\\t\\n\\n8.\\nCan contaminated groundwater
      be cleaned up?\\n\\r\\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. Communities
      whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions
      of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes
      and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the
      cost of providing the water to customers. It is far better to prevent contamination
      in the first place.\_What are the dos and do nots for groundwater?Do: Purchase
      only what you need Use products completely before disposing Recycle whatever
      you can (oil, batteries, etc.) Recycle surplus paintsDo not: Dump products onto
      the ground (they can contaminate soil and groundwater) Pour products or wastes
      into the street (they can contaminate oceans, lakes, and groundwater) Put hazardous
      or toxic products in the trash Pour products down the drainView proper disposal
      of Household Hazardous Wastes online. \\n\\n9.\\nIs our water fluoridated?\\n\\r\\nAt
      this time fluoride is not added to the water. There are low levels of fluoride
      naturally occurring in the water. The range at which they occur is between 0.2
      to 0.8 milligrams per liter (mg/L). \\n             query: I need to do some
      legal research to be prepared for my oral argument. Can I visit the law library?\\n

      what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an oral
      argument.\\nYou can also review these step-by-step guides on how to prepare
      for oral argument and what to do the day of oral argument.\\nWho Can Make an
      Oral Argument\\n\\nAny party \u2013 appellant or respondent \u2013 who filed
      a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal is eligible to make an oral
      argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief, then he or she cannot make
      an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter all the briefs are filed
      or the time to file them has passed, the Court of Appeal contacts each eligible
      party in the case about oral argument.\\nThe Court of Appeal sends notice to
      ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument. Sometimes the
      notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does not.\\nWhen the
      court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want to make an oral
      argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the deadline given
      in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the court will have
      oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties at least 20 days
      advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost
      of Presenting an Oral Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an
      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision
      than the briefs or the record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose
      to make an oral argument or choose to waive (give up) oral argument. \\n passage
      B: On 4 July the impactor struck the sunlit side of the comet nucleus 24 hours
      after release, at 5:52 UT (1:52 a.m. EDT). At 10.2 km/s velocity, the impactor
      had an impact energy of about 19 gigajoules, and hit at an oblique angle of
      approximately 25 degrees. Material from the nucleus was ejected into space and
      the impactor and much of the ejecta was vaporized.\\n\\nThe flyby spacecraft
      was approximately 10,000 km away at the time of impact and began imaging 60
      seconds before impact. At 600 seconds after impact the spacecraft was about
      4000 km from the nucleus and observations of the crater began and continued
      up to a range of about 700 km, about 50 seconds before closest approach. At
      this point (about 961 seconds after impact) imaging ended as the spacecraft
      reoriented itself by 45 degrees to optimize protection from dust damage as it
      flew by the nucleus. Closest approach to the nucleus was at a distance of about
      500 km. At 1270 seconds the crossing of the inner coma was complete and the
      spacecraft oriented itself to look back at the comet and begin imaging again.
      At 3000 seconds the spacecraft began playback of data to Earth at 20 to 200
      kilobits per second. The comet and spacecraft were about 0.89 AU from Earth
      and 1.5 AU from the Sun during the encounter. Real time return of selected impactor
      images and flyby images and spectra were returned to Earth during the encounter.
      Primary data return took place over the first day after encounter, with a 28
      day supplemental data return period. Earth-based observatories also studied
      the impact. The spacecraft ranged over a distance of 0.93 to 1.56 AU from the
      Sun during the primary mission. End of primary mission was August 2005. The
      total budget for the primary mission was $240 million.\\n\\nEPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep
      Impact has been funded for an extended mission which has two parts. The Deep
      Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2
      on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately 700 km. (The original
      target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning images and data.
      The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh) investigation
      used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars with known
      large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and in front
      of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. \\n             query:

      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of their oral argument recording from the court. If a party wants

      \ Why do I have to tell the court in advance if I want to make an oral argument?
      \  The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n
      \ What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want to make
      an oral argument? \\n passage B: The high resolution camera has a FOV of 0.118
      degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km. The infrared spectrometers
      cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res)
      and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus instrument payload has a mass
      of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during encounter.\\n\\nThe flyby spacecraft
      measures approximately 3.2 m x 1.7 m x 2.3 m, is three-axis stabilized and uses
      a blowdown hydrazine primary propulsion system with 5000 N-s RCS total impulse
      providing a total delta-V of 190 m/s. Communications with the ground from the
      flyby bus are via X-band (8.000 MHz) through a 1 meter diameter parabolic dish
      antenna mounted on a 2-axis gimbal or through a fixed low-gain antenna. Communication
      between the impactor and flyby spacecraft is in S-band. The uplink data rate
      will be 125 bps, downlink will be at 175 kbps. Power of 620 W at the encounter
      is provided by a 7.2 square meter solar array and stored in a small NiH2 battery.
      The spacecraft control system consists of four hemispherical resonator gyros,
      two star trackers, reaction wheels, and hydrazine thrusters. Pointing accuracy
      is 200 microradians with 65 microradian knowledge. Thermal control is achieved
      by insulating blankets, surface radiators, finishes, and heaters. The spacecraft
      has two redundant RAD750 computers with 309 MB each of memory for scientific
      data.\\n\\nThe Impactor\\n\\nThe impactor projectile is made of primarily copper
      (49%) and only 24% aluminum so it will be easily identifiable and minimize contamination
      in the spectra after the projectile is largely vaporized and mixed in with the
      comet ejecta on impact. The impactor is a short hexagonal cylinder built above
      the copper cratering mass. It has a small hydrazine propulsion system for targeting
      which can provide delta-V of 25 m/s. Targeting is accomplished using a high-precision
      star-tracker, auto-navigation algorithms, and the Impactor Targeting Sensor
      (ITS), a camera which provides images for autonomous control and targeting.

      passage A: The court will send all parties at least 20 days advance notice including
      the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost of Presenting an Oral
      Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an oral argument.\_\\nDeciding
      Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases oral argument is optional,
      and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases oral argument can be helpful,
      but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision than the briefs or the
      record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose to make an oral argument
      or choose to waive (give up) oral argument.\\nReasons to make an oral argument\\n\\nto
      explain something in a brief\\nto talk about an argument in any party\u2019s
      brief\\nto highlight the most important issues in the appeal\\nto give the justices
      a chance to ask questions\\nto talk about new legal authorities that support
      an argument in a brief\\n\\nReasons not to make an oral argument\\n\\nthere
      is nothing new or different to say about what\u2019s already in a brief\\nthe
      arguments and issues are fully explained in a brief\\na party does not want
      to take questions from the justices\\na party wants to talk about a new legal
      issue or new evidence (this is not permitted in oral argument)\\n\\nHere are
      some important things to know when making a decision about whether or not to
      request oral argument:\\n\\nIf a party chooses not to make an oral argument,
      it does not impact what the court thinks about that party or their argument
      in the appeal.\\n\\nNot all parties have to do the same thing. So if only one
      party wants to make an oral argument, the court will have oral argument for
      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster
      if there is no oral argument, and the court will not take longer to make a decision
      if there is oral argument.\\n\\nMaking an oral argument may or may not help
      a party\u2019s side of the appeal. There is no way to know in advance. \\n passage
      B: By the way, that big thing that hit Earth is called Theia. It also blasted
      a big hole in the surface. That big hit sent a huge amount of dust and rubble
      into orbit. Most scientists think that that rubble, in time, became our Moon.\\nAs
      Earth orbits the Sun, its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So,
      throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the Sun\u2019s direct rays.\\n\\nSometimes
      it is the North Pole tilting toward the Sun (around June) and sometimes it is
      the South Pole tilting toward the Sun (around December). \\nIt is summer in
      June in the Northern Hemisphere because the Sun's rays hit that part of Earth
      more directly than at any other time of the year. It is winter in December in
      the Northern Hemisphere, because that is when it is the South Pole's turn to
      be tilted toward the Sun.\\n\\nEarth's lopsided orbit\\nEarth's perihelion (point
      closest to Sun) = 91,400,000 miles from Sun\\nEarth's aphelion (point farthest
      from Sun) = 94,500,000 miles from Sun\\nWhile that is a difference of over 3
      million miles, relative to the entire distance, it isn\u2019t much.\\n\\nAnd,
      believe it or not, aphelion (when Earth is farthest from the Sun) occurs in
      July, and perihelion (when we are closest) occurs in January. For those of us
      who live in the Northern Hemisphere where it's summer in July and winter in
      January, that seems backwards, doesn't it? That just goes to prove that Earth's
      distance from the Sun is not the cause of the seasons.\\n\\nRelated Resources

      are a smart and helpful AI assistant with in-depth knowledge about how people
      search for information using search engines. In this task, you are given two
      passages, and a query, your job is to judge which passage is relatively more
      suitable to answer that query. The first passage will start with \\\"passage
      A\\\" and the second passage with start with \\\"passage B\\\". Output the preferred
      passage index, i.e. A or B and followed by an explanation, if none of the passage
      answer the query directly, pick the one that has more relevant information.\\n\\n
      passage A: The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases
      every year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One
      rule is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know
      people want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument
      in every case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time
      that they could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would
      slow down every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n
      \ \\n  What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want
      to make an oral argument?   If you do not tell the Court of Appeal that you
      want to make an oral argument, the court will assume you do not want to participate.
      If this happens you will lose your chance to have oral argument unless the other
      side requests oral argument. If the other side requests oral argument and you
      do not, you may still participate in oral argument if you filed a brief.\\nIf
      you want to make an oral argument, the only way to guarantee you have the opportunity
      is to respond by the deadline in the court\u2019s notice and go to the court
      on the day of oral argument for your case. There are no exceptions and no extensions
      for more time. After the time for oral argument passes, the court moves on to
      make a decision on your appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I talk about what\u2019s in my
      brief or not?   Yes, you can talk about things that are in your brief. But you
      should not read directly from the brief. Instead you should tell the justices
      what you think is the most important part of the appeal. You can explain more
      about what you want them to think about most in your brief. It is a mistake
      to spend the short time you have for oral argument saying the exact same thing
      that the justices have already read in your brief.\\n  \\n  Will it affect the
      court\u2019s decision if I get nervous or I can\u2019t answer all the questions?
      \  Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in mind that
      the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The justices
      understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some people
      are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know that the
      justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak, the
      justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs. Even
      though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may not
      have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. \\n passage B: It
      has a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the
      Sun to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between
      the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for
      at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and
      4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter.
      The comet was discovered on 3 April 1867 by Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel and
      was first recognized to be periodic in May of that year by C. Bruhns.\\n\\nComet
      Hartley 2\\n\\nComet 103P/Hartley, commonly known as Hartley 2, is a periodic
      comet which takes 6.46 years to orbit the Sun. Its semi-major axis is 3.46 AU

      7 days before encounter. Its orbit is inclined 13.6 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The elongated nucleus is about 2 km long by 0.5 km wide. It was discovered by

      the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs.
      Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may
      not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. Remember that
      oral argument is one small part of the whole appeal process. So while it can
      help your case, it is not the most important of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does
      my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will
      present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are
      not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a
      transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case?   All oral arguments
      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you
      want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription
      service and pay them a separate fee.\\n  \\n  What does the court think if I
      do not make an oral argument?   If you decide not to make an oral argument,
      the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t
      care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief.
      The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If
      you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the
      court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How will the court decide if there are no
      oral arguments?   If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.

      Science for Kids\\n\\nseasons\\n\\nVea en Espa\xF1ol\\n\\nEarth\\nSun\\nSolar
      System\\nUniverse\\nScience and Tech\\nEducators\\n\\nWhat Causes the Seasons?\\n\\nThe
      Short Answer:\\n\\r\\n\\tEarth's tilted axis causes the seasons. Throughout
      the year, different parts of Earth receive the Sun's most direct rays. So, when
      the North Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere.
      And when the South Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nIt's
      all about Earth's tilt!\\nMany people believe that Earth is closer to the Sun
      in the summer and that is why it is hotter. And, likewise, they think Earth
      is farthest from the Sun in the winter.\\nAlthough this idea makes sense, it
      is incorrect.\\nIt is true that Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle. It is
      a bit lop-sided. During part of the year, Earth is closer to the Sun than at
      other times. However, in the Northern Hemisphere, we are having winter when
      Earth is closest to the Sun and summer when it is farthest away! Compared with
      how far away the Sun is, this change in Earth's distance throughout the year
      does not make much difference to our weather.\\nThere is a different reason
      for Earth's seasons.\\nEarth's axis is an imaginary pole going right through
      the center of Earth from \\\"top\\\" to \\\"bottom.\\\" Earth spins around this
      pole, making one complete turn each day. That is why we have day and night,
      and why every part of Earth's surface gets some of each.\\nEarth has seasons
      because its axis doesn't stand up straight. \\nBut what caused Earth to tilt?\\n\\nLong,
      long ago, when Earth was young, it is thought that something big hit Earth and
      knocked it off-kilter. So instead of rotating with its axis straight up and
      down, it leans over a bit.\\nBy the way, that big thing that hit Earth is called
      Theia. It also blasted a big hole in the surface. That big hit sent a huge amount
      of dust and rubble into orbit. Most scientists think that that rubble, in time,
      became our Moon.\\nAs Earth orbits the Sun, its tilted axis always points in
      the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the
      Sun\u2019s direct rays.\\n\\nSometimes it is the North Pole tilting toward the
      Sun (around June) and sometimes it is the South Pole tilting toward the Sun
      (around December). \\n             query: I need to do some legal research to

      passage A: Many appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive
      (give up) oral argument. When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal
      justices decide an appeal based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral
      argument does not slow down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will
      not make a decision faster if there is no oral argument, and the court will
      not take longer to make a decision if there is oral argument.\\n\\nMaking an
      oral argument may or may not help a party\u2019s side of the appeal. There is
      no way to know in advance.\\n\\nIf the appellant decides not to make an oral
      argument, then the respondent usually does not make an oral argument. This is
      because the law favors the respondent in an appeal.\\n\\nIt does not happen
      often, but in some cases the Court of Appeal will require a party to participate
      in oral argument. The court may do this if it has specific questions to ask
      a party.\\n\\nTelling the Court if You Will Make an Oral Argument\\n\\nThe Court
      of Appeal permits oral argument in every appeal case. But the court will only
      schedule time for oral argument if it receives notice from any parties who want
      to participate.\\nWhen to tell the court\\nWhen a party receives notice about
      oral argument from the Court of Appeal, they must respond by the deadline in
      the notice.\\nHow to tell the court\\nTo say YES and make an oral argument,
      a party must tell the Court of Appeal by the deadline given in the court\u2019s
      notice. The party must tell the court in writing.\\nTo say NO and not make an
      oral argument, a party can simply do nothing. If the court does not receive
      a response, it will assume the party is waiving oral argument.\\nPreparing for
      Oral Argument\\n\\nDuring oral argument there is a short amount of time to talk
      to the Court of Appeal justices and answer questions, so it\u2019s important
      to be prepared.\\nBefore oral argument a party should spend time getting ready.
      This includes reviewing the record on appeal, all the briefs, and the most important
      legal authorities.\\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide on HOW TO PREPARE for
      oral argument.\\nWhat to talk about\\nHere are some general rules about what
      an appellant or respondent should and should not discuss in oral argument. \\n
      passage B: EPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended
      mission which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved
      flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately
      700 km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning
      images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh)
      investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars
      with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and
      in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase
      of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The
      spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley
      2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations
      of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on
      4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of
      roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156
      AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution
      at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are
      known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet
      Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications
      could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that
      the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total
      cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\\n\\nComet Tempel 1\\n\\nComet
      9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has
      a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun
      to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the
      orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for
      at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and
      4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter.

      The query asks about preparing for an oral argument in a legal context, which
      pertains to legal research. Passage B, EPOXI Extended Mission, discusses space
      exploration and does not provide any information about visiting a law library
      for legal research. Passage A, on the other hand, focuses on the process of
      oral arguments in court cases, including the decision-making process and the

      A: Freshwater Fishing\n        \n\nGeneral information on fishing includes fishing
      tips with links to seasons, rules & regulations. You can ensure of continued
      good fishing opportunities in the future by fishing responsibly. If you have
      never been fishing but want to try, it''s easy to learn how to fish.\nAll waters
      within the Cedarlands Conservation Easement are open to fishing. Anglers may
      use the same trailheads and trails as hikers, the same hand launches as paddlers,
      and the same campsites as campers to access and fish these waters.\nMud Pond
      contains largemouth bass, yellow perch, brown bullhead and sunfish. The pond
      can be accessed from a hand launch on its northern shore off the Fishing Camp
      Trail - approximately 0.75 mile from the trailhead parking area.\nMcRorie Lake
      contains largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, brown bullhead and
      sunfish. The lake can be accessed by paddling from Mud Pond up the lake''s outlet
      and a 0.25-mile carry.\nIce fishing is allowed on both waterbodies.\nAdirondack/Lake
      Champlain Fishing provides information on fishing in the Adirondacks and links
      to top fishing waters, stocking lists, public fishing access and waters open
      to ice fishing listed by county.\n\n        Hunting\n        \n\nGeneral Information
      on hunting includes how-to and safety tips with links to seasons, rules & regulations.\nHunters
      may use the parking area and trails used by hikers, and the hand launches used
      by paddlers to access the lands and waters in this area.\nWhite-tailed deer,
      black bear, varying hare, ruffed grouse, waterfowl and other game species are
      present.\nTrapping is not permitted on these lands.\n\n        Watchable Wildlife\n        \n\nGeneral
      information on animals includes links to information about birds, mammals, fish,
      reptiles, amphibians and insects that inhabit or migrate through the state.\nThe
      Adirondacks contain large tracts of wildlife habitat with some boreal, bog,
      alpine and other unique habitats. Many species of birds and mammals are unique
      to the Adirondacks or are mainly found here. More than 50 species of mammals
      and hundreds of species of birds inhabit or pass through the Adirondacks at
      one time of the year or another so it is not unlikely to catch site of wildlife
      during your trip.\nMore information on Adirondack Flora and Fauna (leaves DEC

      to move south to north beginning early Wednesday and continue through Thanksgiving
      on Thursday. While the storm is not predicted to become severe at this time,

      \n\nSafe Winter Driving Tips\n\n    Safe Winter Driving Tips\n  \nDrive Safely\nThe
      leading cause of death and injuries during winter storms is transportation accidents.\nWhen
      winter storms strike, do not drive unless necessary.\nKeep vehicles clear of
      ice and snow. Good vision is a key to good driving.\nPlan your stops and keep
      more distance between cars. Be extra alert. Remember, snowdrifts can hide smaller
      children. Always match your speed to the road and weather conditions.\nSome
      of the most important tips for safe winter driving include:\nSchedule extra
      time for winter travel and be patient during ice and snow removal operations.\nNever
      follow a snowplow too closely or attempt to pass one. Remember that the highway
      ahead of the plow is usually snow-covered.\nAssume that bridge surfaces are
      slippery, as they freeze more quickly than road surfaces.\nBe wary of black
      ice, which can be difficult to see but makes conditions slippery when pavement
      temperatures are below freezing.\nHave a cell phone handy and charged.\nEquip
      your car with emergency supplies.\nInform a responsible person of your destination,
      intended route, and estimated time of arrival.\nKeep calm and do not panic in
      case of a vehicle breakdown, accident, or if you become snowbound.\nKeep your
      gas tank full to prevent gasoline freeze-up.\nTrapped in a Car\nStay in your
      car and wait for help to find you.\nRun your engine for short periods of time
      to stay warm. Keep your down-wind window open and make sure your exhaust pipe
      is clear of snow.\nTurn on the dome light at night when you are running the

      passage A: Preparing for Oral Argument\\n\\nDuring oral argument there is a
      short amount of time to talk to the Court of Appeal justices and answer questions,
      so it\u2019s important to be prepared.\\nBefore oral argument a party should
      spend time getting ready. This includes reviewing the record on appeal, all
      the briefs, and the most important legal authorities.\\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step
      guide on HOW TO PREPARE for oral argument.\\nWhat to talk about\\nHere are some
      general rules about what an appellant or respondent should and should not discuss
      in oral argument.\_\\nDO:\\n\\nfocus on the legal issues in the appeal\\nexplain
      arguments you made in your brief\\ntalk about legal issues that are in your
      brief\\nclarify issues you talked about in your brief\\ntalk about legal issues
      or argument in the other party\u2019s brief\\ntalk about new legal authorities
      such as a new case or change to a law (you or the other side must notify the
      court of new legal authorities before oral argument)\\ntell the justices what
      you think is most important in your appeal\\nask the justices if they have questions
      for you\\n\\nDO NOT:\\n\\ntalk about new evidence\\nintroduce new legal issues
      or new arguments that are not in any of the briefs\\nread your brief out loud\\nrepeat
      what\u2019s in your brief word-for-word\\nrepeat or argue the facts of the case\\n\\nHow
      much time to talk\\nThe court sends notice in advance to each party who is participating
      in oral argument. The notice says how much time the party will have to talk.
      Generally each party has between 15 and 30 minutes to talk in oral argument.
      Keep in mind this also includes questions from the justices.\\nIf a party has
      a lawyer, then the lawyer will talk in oral argument.\_\_\\nWhat to expect from
      the justices\\nThe Court of Appeal justices do many of the same things the parties
      do to prepare for oral argument. The justices fully review the record on appeal,
      so they know what happened in the trial court. The justices also read all the
      briefs and research the legal authorities, so they know about the legal issues
      in the appeal. During oral argument the justices will listen to the parties
      and they may ask questions.\\nThe Day of Oral Argument\\n\\nThe court has rules
      about oral argument and the parties are expected to follow the rules.\\nHere\u2019s
      a step-by-step guide on WHAT TO DO THE DAY OF ORAL ARGUMENT.\\nHere are some
      keys to making a successful oral argument:\\nBE PREPARED\\n\\nBring an outline
      of your key points and look at it when you need to. \\n passage B: The impactor
      is a short hexagonal cylinder built above the copper cratering mass. It has
      a small hydrazine propulsion system for targeting which can provide delta-V
      of 25 m/s. Targeting is accomplished using a high-precision star-tracker, auto-navigation
      algorithms, and the Impactor Targeting Sensor (ITS), a camera which provides
      images for autonomous control and targeting. The ITS will operate until impact,
      and images will be sent back to Earth via the flyby spacecraft. Damage to the
      instrument due to dust in the coma may make imaging impossible duing the last
      minute or so before impact. Communication with the flyby spacecraft is via S-band.
      The impactor is mechanically and electrically connected to the flyby spacecraft
      until 24 hours prior to encounter. After separation it runs on internal battery
      power.\\n\\nFor the Deep Impact Impactor (DII) spacecraft record, see:\\n\\nhttp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2005-001D\\n\\nMission
      Profile\\n\\nDeep Impact launched on 12 January 2005 at 18:47:08.574 UT (1:47:08
      p.m. EST) on a Delta II. The spacecraft transferred into a heliocentric orbit
      and will rendezvous with comet P/Tempel 1 in July 2005. Deep Impact was 880,000
      km from the comet on 3 July 2005 moving at a velocity of 10.2 km/s relative
      to the comet. The projectile was released at this point and shortly after release
      the flyby spacecraft executed a maneuver to slow down relative to the impactor
      by 120 m/s and divert by 6 m/s. On 4 July the impactor struck the sunlit side
      of the comet nucleus 24 hours after release, at 5:52 UT (1:52 a.m. EDT). At
      10.2 km/s velocity, the impactor had an impact energy of about 19 gigajoules,
      and hit at an oblique angle of approximately 25 degrees. Material from the nucleus
      was ejected into space and the impactor and much of the ejecta was vaporized.\\n\\nThe
      flyby spacecraft was approximately 10,000 km away at the time of impact and
      began imaging 60 seconds before impact. \\n             query: I need to do

      Monterey Park Police Department at 626-573-1311. \_You will be able to speak
      to someone 24 hours a day. \\n\\n3.\\nWhat is our source of water?\\n\\r\\nThe
      City of Monterey Park Water System receives its water supply from one source
      - local groundwater. The water is produced by 12 City-owned wells with a total
      capacity of 20 million gallons per day (mgd). The wells reach a depth of up
      to 1,800 feet and are located in the vicinity of the Rio Hondo, which is outside
      the city limits and in the Main San Gabriel groundwater basin. Water from our
      deep wells is of excellent quality and requires little or no treatment. The
      Monterey Park Water System supplies an average of 10 mgd to its customers.On
      average, about 65% of the water used each year is supplied from local rainfall;
      the other 35% is imported from northern California and then percolated into
      the groundwater aquifers. The water is imported for us by the San Gabriel Valley
      Municipal Water District, a public agency, and of which the City of Monterey
      Park is a member.\\t\\n\\n4.\\nHow much water does the Monterey Park community
      use?\\n\\r\\nUsage ranges from an average low of 7.3 million gallons per day
      (mgd) in February to an average high of 12 mgd in August. Average use per person
      is 100-110 gallons per day.\\t\\n\\n5.\\nWhat is ground water?\\n\\r\\nContrary
      to what a lot of people think, groundwater is not found in underground rivers
      or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks
      and sediments that lie beneath the surface of the earth, much the way water
      fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge or towel. \\t\\n\\n6.\\nWhy is
      keeping our groundwater clean so important?\\n\\r\\nThe San Gabriel Valley is
      unique in that it is one of the few natural underground reservoirs in the United
      States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through
      a series of dams and are then diverted to \\\"spreading basins\\\". Spreading
      basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and
      gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of the water served
      to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater. \\n             query:

      along the shore of Mud Pond. Two of the sites are on the east side of the pond,
      while one is on the north shore.\\nOne primitive tent site and one lean-to on
      McRorie Lake are available to the public from August 24 to June 23.\\nCampers
      who desire more amenities may camp at the nearby Lake Eaton Campground and take
      day trips into the Cedarlands Conservation Easement.\\n\\n        Paddling\\n

      and links to rules & regulations. The public is not allowed to use motor boats
      on this easement.\\nMud Pond can be accessed from two hand launches. One access
      is at the end of a 0.3-mile-long trail that leaves from the north side of the
      parking area. The other access is on the northern shore which is reached from
      the Fishing Camp Trail about 0.75 mile from the trailhead parking area. The
      pond offers a quiet paddle with scenic views, fishing, and opportunities for
      wildlife viewing.\\nMcRorie Lake can be accessed by paddling from Mud Pond to
      near the lake's outlet and a 0.25-mile carry, or by walking the Fishing Camp

      || Google Earth || DECinfo LocatorThe 4,890-acre Cedarlands Conservation Easement
      Tract is part of the Conservation Easement Lands of the Adirondacks and is currently
      owned by the Leatherstocking Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The central
      features of the area are two water bodies, Mud Pond and McRorie Lake (previously
      known as Rock Pond). There are also two prominent mountains, Rock Pond Mountain
      and Mud Pond Mountain.There is no public use of the adjacent Base Camp Area.The
      public portion of the easement lands is divided into two areas. The 590-acre
      Mud Pond Area is open for public use year-round. While the 3,300-acre McRorie
      Lake Area is open to public use from August 24 to June 23.A conservation easement
      is a partnership with the private landowner that allows public access while
      protecting open space by limiting development. The private landowner retains
      the right to manage the property for purposes such as sustainable timber production.
      Logging trucks, skidders, and other logging equipment may be present during
      logging operations. Before recreating, please review the map and rules that
      apply to the places you want to use. \\n passage B: However, you can cancel
      your ride and book a new ride that suits your pick-up or drop-off location.A
      ride can be cancelled with the MoGo app, online on the web booking site (book.mogo.rideco.com)
      or by calling 408-330-3302.To cancel a ride in the MoGo app, click the Menu
      in the top left corner. Select \\\"My Rides\\\". \_Click the \\\"Upcoming\\\"
      tab to view your scheduled rides. Click on the ride you wish to cancel. Then
      click the \\\"Cancel the Ride\\\" button directly below the map image.\_If you
      have pre-paid for your ride with a credit or debit card, a credit will be applied
      to your account.You can then book a new ride (subject to availability).\_ \\n\\n6.\\nWhat
      if I cancel or do not show for my ride?\\n\\nWhen you book a ride with MoGo
      you are making a commitment to the system and the driver as a schedule is created
      to accommodate your trip. If due to some reason you are not able to take the
      ride, we advise you to cancel as soon as possible. \_To ensure that all MoGo
      customers have access to book rides, we have updated our policy. Effective December
      15, 2023, we will limit bookings for MoGo users with excessive late cancellations
      or no-shows.\_Who is impacted: Customers with at least\_10 rides booked in the
      last 60 days that have cancelled late* and/or were a no-show for\_20% of their
      rides. (*Cancelled rides are counted only if they are cancelled within 2 hours
      of the trip departure.)What will happen: Those who fall in this threshold, will
      have their ability to book rides limited for 7 days. During the 7 days they
      can only book rides up to 48 hours in advance and have at most 3 upcoming trips
      booked.Customers who cancel late and no-show to their MoGo trips cause fewer
      rides available to others. In October 2023, 11% of MoGo users accounted for
      50% of cancellations and no-shows. Fewer cancellations and no-shows improves
      MoGo's system capacity. Thank you for your assistance helping MoGo get our community
      to where they need to go! \\n\\n7.\\nHow do I pay for my ride?\\n\\nIn the MoGo
      app or on the booking website, payments are made at the time of booking with

      \ Why do I have to tell the court in advance if I want to make an oral argument?
      \  The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n
      \ What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want to make
      an oral argument? \\n passage B: Employers are not required by law to compensate
      employees with their regular wages while on jury duty. Many employers do have
      jury benefits and will continue\\r\\n            wages while serving.\\r\\n

      service.\\r\\n            Jurors employed by government agencies or districts
      receive regular salary during service, therefore no juror fees are paid to those\\r\\n
      \           jurors pursuant to provisions of the law.\\r\\n        \\n\\r\\n
      \           Jurors serving their second and additional days of jury service

      \\n8.\_Oral Argument\\nOral argument is the last step in the appeal process
      before the Court of Appeal makes a decision.\\nDuring oral argument, all parties
      who filed a brief are offered a limited amount of time to speak directly to
      the Court of Appeal justices before they decide the appeal.\\nOral argument
      is an opportunity for the parties to make sure the court understands the most
      important issues of an appeal. The parties can explain the arguments in their
      briefs and answer questions from the justices.\\nHere\u2019s an overview of
      what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an oral
      argument.\\nYou can also review these step-by-step guides on how to prepare
      for oral argument and what to do the day of oral argument.\\nWho Can Make an
      Oral Argument\\n\\nAny party \u2013 appellant or respondent \u2013 who filed
      a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal is eligible to make an oral
      argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief, then he or she cannot make
      an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter all the briefs are filed
      or the time to file them has passed, the Court of Appeal contacts each eligible
      party in the case about oral argument.\\nThe Court of Appeal sends notice to
      ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument. Sometimes the
      notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does not.\\nWhen the
      court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want to make an oral
      argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the deadline given
      in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the court will have
      oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties at least 20 days
      advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost
      of Presenting an Oral Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an
      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision
      than the briefs or the record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose
      to make an oral argument or choose to waive (give up) oral argument. \\n passage

      are a smart and helpful AI assistant with in-depth knowledge about how people
      search for information using search engines. In this task, you are given two
      passages, and a query, your job is to judge which passage is relatively more
      suitable to answer that query. The first passage will start with \\\"passage
      A\\\" and the second passage with start with \\\"passage B\\\". Output the preferred
      passage index, i.e. A or B and followed by an explanation, if none of the passage
      answer the query directly, pick the one that has more relevant information.\\n\\n
      passage A: The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases
      every year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One
      rule is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know
      people want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument
      in every case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time
      that they could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would
      slow down every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n
      \ \\n  What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want
      to make an oral argument?   If you do not tell the Court of Appeal that you
      want to make an oral argument, the court will assume you do not want to participate.
      If this happens you will lose your chance to have oral argument unless the other
      side requests oral argument. If the other side requests oral argument and you
      do not, you may still participate in oral argument if you filed a brief.\\nIf
      you want to make an oral argument, the only way to guarantee you have the opportunity
      is to respond by the deadline in the court\u2019s notice and go to the court
      on the day of oral argument for your case. There are no exceptions and no extensions
      for more time. After the time for oral argument passes, the court moves on to
      make a decision on your appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I talk about what\u2019s in my
      brief or not?   Yes, you can talk about things that are in your brief. But you
      should not read directly from the brief. Instead you should tell the justices
      what you think is the most important part of the appeal. You can explain more
      about what you want them to think about most in your brief. It is a mistake
      to spend the short time you have for oral argument saying the exact same thing
      that the justices have already read in your brief.\\n  \\n  Will it affect the
      court\u2019s decision if I get nervous or I can\u2019t answer all the questions?
      \  Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in mind that
      the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The justices
      understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some people
      are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know that the
      justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak, the
      justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs. Even
      though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may not
      have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. \\n passage B: Examples
      of hate incidents include:Name-callingInsultsDisplaying hate material on your
      own property.Posting hate material that does not result in property damage.Distribution
      of materials with hate messages in public places.The U.S. Constitution allows
      hate speech as long as it does not interfere with the civil rights of others.
      While these acts are certainly hurtful, they do not rise to the level of criminal
      violations and thus may not be prosecuted. However, it is important to note
      that these incidents have a traumatic impact on the victims as well as on the
      community at large.Fact sheets are available in multiple languages at\_https://oag.ca.gov/hatecrimes

      the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost of Presenting an Oral
      Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an oral argument.\_\\nDeciding
      Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases oral argument is optional,
      and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases oral argument can be helpful,
      but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision than the briefs or the
      record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose to make an oral argument
      or choose to waive (give up) oral argument.\\nReasons to make an oral argument\\n\\nto
      explain something in a brief\\nto talk about an argument in any party\u2019s
      brief\\nto highlight the most important issues in the appeal\\nto give the justices
      a chance to ask questions\\nto talk about new legal authorities that support
      an argument in a brief\\n\\nReasons not to make an oral argument\\n\\nthere
      is nothing new or different to say about what\u2019s already in a brief\\nthe
      arguments and issues are fully explained in a brief\\na party does not want
      to take questions from the justices\\na party wants to talk about a new legal
      issue or new evidence (this is not permitted in oral argument)\\n\\nHere are
      some important things to know when making a decision about whether or not to
      request oral argument:\\n\\nIf a party chooses not to make an oral argument,
      it does not impact what the court thinks about that party or their argument
      in the appeal.\\n\\nNot all parties have to do the same thing. So if only one
      party wants to make an oral argument, the court will have oral argument for
      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster
      if there is no oral argument, and the court will not take longer to make a decision
      if there is oral argument.\\n\\nMaking an oral argument may or may not help
      a party\u2019s side of the appeal. There is no way to know in advance. \\n passage

      || Google Earth || DECinfo LocatorThe 4,890-acre Cedarlands Conservation Easement
      Tract is part of the Conservation Easement Lands of the Adirondacks and is currently
      owned by the Leatherstocking Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The central
      features of the area are two water bodies, Mud Pond and McRorie Lake (previously
      known as Rock Pond). There are also two prominent mountains, Rock Pond Mountain
      and Mud Pond Mountain.There is no public use of the adjacent Base Camp Area.The
      public portion of the easement lands is divided into two areas. The 590-acre
      Mud Pond Area is open for public use year-round. While the 3,300-acre McRorie
      Lake Area is open to public use from August 24 to June 23.A conservation easement
      is a partnership with the private landowner that allows public access while
      protecting open space by limiting development. The private landowner retains
      the right to manage the property for purposes such as sustainable timber production.
      Logging trucks, skidders, and other logging equipment may be present during
      logging operations. Before recreating, please review the map and rules that

      passage A: Preparing for Oral Argument\\n\\nDuring oral argument there is a
      short amount of time to talk to the Court of Appeal justices and answer questions,
      so it\u2019s important to be prepared.\\nBefore oral argument a party should
      spend time getting ready. This includes reviewing the record on appeal, all
      the briefs, and the most important legal authorities.\\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step
      guide on HOW TO PREPARE for oral argument.\\nWhat to talk about\\nHere are some
      general rules about what an appellant or respondent should and should not discuss
      in oral argument.\_\\nDO:\\n\\nfocus on the legal issues in the appeal\\nexplain
      arguments you made in your brief\\ntalk about legal issues that are in your
      brief\\nclarify issues you talked about in your brief\\ntalk about legal issues
      or argument in the other party\u2019s brief\\ntalk about new legal authorities
      such as a new case or change to a law (you or the other side must notify the
      court of new legal authorities before oral argument)\\ntell the justices what
      you think is most important in your appeal\\nask the justices if they have questions
      for you\\n\\nDO NOT:\\n\\ntalk about new evidence\\nintroduce new legal issues
      or new arguments that are not in any of the briefs\\nread your brief out loud\\nrepeat
      what\u2019s in your brief word-for-word\\nrepeat or argue the facts of the case\\n\\nHow
      much time to talk\\nThe court sends notice in advance to each party who is participating
      in oral argument. The notice says how much time the party will have to talk.
      Generally each party has between 15 and 30 minutes to talk in oral argument.
      Keep in mind this also includes questions from the justices.\\nIf a party has
      a lawyer, then the lawyer will talk in oral argument.\_\_\\nWhat to expect from
      the justices\\nThe Court of Appeal justices do many of the same things the parties
      do to prepare for oral argument. The justices fully review the record on appeal,
      so they know what happened in the trial court. The justices also read all the
      briefs and research the legal authorities, so they know about the legal issues
      in the appeal. During oral argument the justices will listen to the parties
      and they may ask questions.\\nThe Day of Oral Argument\\n\\nThe court has rules
      about oral argument and the parties are expected to follow the rules.\\nHere\u2019s
      a step-by-step guide on WHAT TO DO THE DAY OF ORAL ARGUMENT.\\nHere are some
      keys to making a successful oral argument:\\nBE PREPARED\\n\\nBring an outline

      (start at 19:25).More information is available on the State of California Department
      of Justice website at\_https://oag.ca.gov/hatecrimesA\_hate crime is a crime
      against a person, group, or property motivated by the victim's real or perceived
      protected social group. You may be the victim of a hate crime if you have been
      targeted because of your actual or perceived: (1) disability, (2) gender, (3)
      nationality, (4) race or ethnicity, (5) religion, (6) sexual orientation, and
      (7) association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived
      characteristics. Hate crimes are serious crimes that may result in imprisonment
      or jail time.A\_hate incident is an action or behavior motivated by hate but
      which, for one or more reasons, is not a crime. Examples of hate incidents include:Name-callingInsultsDisplaying
      hate material on your own property.Posting hate material that does not result
      in property damage.Distribution of materials with hate messages in public places.The
      U.S. Constitution allows hate speech as long as it does not interfere with the
      civil rights of others. While these acts are certainly hurtful, they do not
      rise to the level of criminal violations and thus may not be prosecuted. \\n

      \_You will be able to speak to someone 24 hours a day. \\n\\n3.\\nWhat is our
      source of water?\\n\\r\\nThe City of Monterey Park Water System receives its
      water supply from one source - local groundwater. The water is produced by 12
      City-owned wells with a total capacity of 20 million gallons per day (mgd).
      The wells reach a depth of up to 1,800 feet and are located in the vicinity
      of the Rio Hondo, which is outside the city limits and in the Main San Gabriel
      groundwater basin. Water from our deep wells is of excellent quality and requires
      little or no treatment. The Monterey Park Water System supplies an average of
      10 mgd to its customers.On average, about 65% of the water used each year is
      supplied from local rainfall; the other 35% is imported from northern California
      and then percolated into the groundwater aquifers. The water is imported for
      us by the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a public agency, and
      of which the City of Monterey Park is a member.\\t\\n\\n4.\\nHow much water
      does the Monterey Park community use?\\n\\r\\nUsage ranges from an average low
      of 7.3 million gallons per day (mgd) in February to an average high of 12 mgd
      in August. Average use per person is 100-110 gallons per day.\\t\\n\\n5.\\nWhat
      is ground water?\\n\\r\\nContrary to what a lot of people think, groundwater
      is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills
      the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments that lie beneath the surface
      of the earth, much the way water fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge
      or towel. \\t\\n\\n6.\\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\\n\\r\\nThe
      San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground
      reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel
      Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \\\"spreading basins\\\".
      Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such
      as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of
      the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater.

      that the justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak,
      the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs.
      Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may
      not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. Remember that
      oral argument is one small part of the whole appeal process. So while it can
      help your case, it is not the most important of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does
      my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will
      present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are
      not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a
      transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case?   All oral arguments
      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you
      want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription
      service and pay them a separate fee.\\n  \\n  What does the court think if I
      do not make an oral argument?   If you decide not to make an oral argument,
      the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t
      care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief.
      The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If
      you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the
      court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How will the court decide if there are no
      oral arguments?   If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.

      2024\\n\\nDeep Impact/EPOXINSSDCA/COSPAR ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe goals
      of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch
      a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta, much
      of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater
      formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly
      the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to:
      improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and
      directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the
      surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the
      crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers
      of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by
      comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and
      improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during
      encounter. \\n passage B: David R. Williams\_PersonnelNameRoleOriginal\_AffiliationE-mailDr.

      passage A: EPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended
      mission which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved
      flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately
      700 km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning
      images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh)
      investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars
      with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and
      in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase
      of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The
      spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley
      2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations
      of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on
      4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of
      roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156
      AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution
      at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are
      known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet
      Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications
      could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that
      the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total
      cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\\n\\nComet Tempel 1\\n\\nComet
      9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has
      a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun
      to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the
      orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for
      at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and
      4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter.
      \\n passage B: How do I schedule a MoGo ride?\\n\\nBook trips with the MoGo

      Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an oral argument.\_\\nDeciding
      Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases oral argument is optional,
      and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases oral argument can be helpful,
      but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision than the briefs or the
      record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose to make an oral argument
      or choose to waive (give up) oral argument.\\nReasons to make an oral argument\\n\\nto
      explain something in a brief\\nto talk about an argument in any party\u2019s
      brief\\nto highlight the most important issues in the appeal\\nto give the justices
      a chance to ask questions\\nto talk about new legal authorities that support
      an argument in a brief\\n\\nReasons not to make an oral argument\\n\\nthere
      is nothing new or different to say about what\u2019s already in a brief\\nthe
      arguments and issues are fully explained in a brief\\na party does not want
      to take questions from the justices\\na party wants to talk about a new legal
      issue or new evidence (this is not permitted in oral argument)\\n\\nHere are
      some important things to know when making a decision about whether or not to
      request oral argument:\\n\\nIf a party chooses not to make an oral argument,
      it does not impact what the court thinks about that party or their argument
      in the appeal.\\n\\nNot all parties have to do the same thing. So if only one
      party wants to make an oral argument, the court will have oral argument for
      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster
      if there is no oral argument, and the court will not take longer to make a decision
      if there is oral argument.\\n\\nMaking an oral argument may or may not help
      a party\u2019s side of the appeal. There is no way to know in advance. \\n passage

      are a smart and helpful AI assistant with in-depth knowledge about how people
      search for information using search engines. In this task, you are given two
      passages, and a query, your job is to judge which passage is relatively more
      suitable to answer that query. The first passage will start with \\\"passage
      A\\\" and the second passage with start with \\\"passage B\\\". Output the preferred
      passage index, i.e. A or B and followed by an explanation, if none of the passage
      answer the query directly, pick the one that has more relevant information.\\n\\n
      passage A: The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases
      every year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One
      rule is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know
      people want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument
      in every case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time
      that they could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would
      slow down every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n
      \ \\n  What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want
      to make an oral argument?   If you do not tell the Court of Appeal that you
      want to make an oral argument, the court will assume you do not want to participate.
      If this happens you will lose your chance to have oral argument unless the other
      side requests oral argument. If the other side requests oral argument and you
      do not, you may still participate in oral argument if you filed a brief.\\nIf
      you want to make an oral argument, the only way to guarantee you have the opportunity
      is to respond by the deadline in the court\u2019s notice and go to the court
      on the day of oral argument for your case. There are no exceptions and no extensions
      for more time. After the time for oral argument passes, the court moves on to
      make a decision on your appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I talk about what\u2019s in my
      brief or not?   Yes, you can talk about things that are in your brief. But you
      should not read directly from the brief. Instead you should tell the justices
      what you think is the most important part of the appeal. You can explain more
      about what you want them to think about most in your brief. It is a mistake
      to spend the short time you have for oral argument saying the exact same thing
      that the justices have already read in your brief.\\n  \\n  Will it affect the
      court\u2019s decision if I get nervous or I can\u2019t answer all the questions?
      \  Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in mind that
      the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The justices
      understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some people
      are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know that the
      justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak, the
      justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs. Even
      though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may not
      have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. \\n passage B: Syringes

      \\n8.\_Oral Argument\\nOral argument is the last step in the appeal process
      before the Court of Appeal makes a decision.\\nDuring oral argument, all parties
      who filed a brief are offered a limited amount of time to speak directly to
      the Court of Appeal justices before they decide the appeal.\\nOral argument
      is an opportunity for the parties to make sure the court understands the most
      important issues of an appeal. The parties can explain the arguments in their
      briefs and answer questions from the justices.\\nHere\u2019s an overview of
      what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an oral
      argument.\\nYou can also review these step-by-step guides on how to prepare
      for oral argument and what to do the day of oral argument.\\nWho Can Make an
      Oral Argument\\n\\nAny party \u2013 appellant or respondent \u2013 who filed
      a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal is eligible to make an oral
      argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief, then he or she cannot make
      an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter all the briefs are filed
      or the time to file them has passed, the Court of Appeal contacts each eligible
      party in the case about oral argument.\\nThe Court of Appeal sends notice to
      ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument. Sometimes the
      notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does not.\\nWhen the
      court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want to make an oral
      argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the deadline given
      in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the court will have
      oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties at least 20 days
      advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost
      of Presenting an Oral Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an
      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision
      than the briefs or the record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose

      spend time getting ready. This includes reviewing the record on appeal, all

      such as a new case or change to a law (you or the other side must notify the

      what\u2019s in your brief word-for-word\\nrepeat or argue the facts of the case\\n\\nHow
      much time to talk\\nThe court sends notice in advance to each party who is participating
      in oral argument. The notice says how much time the party will have to talk.
      Generally each party has between 15 and 30 minutes to talk in oral argument.
      Keep in mind this also includes questions from the justices.\\nIf a party has
      a lawyer, then the lawyer will talk in oral argument.\_\_\\nWhat to expect from
      the justices\\nThe Court of Appeal justices do many of the same things the parties
      do to prepare for oral argument. The justices fully review the record on appeal,
      so they know what happened in the trial court. The justices also read all the
      briefs and research the legal authorities, so they know about the legal issues
      in the appeal. During oral argument the justices will listen to the parties
      and they may ask questions.\\nThe Day of Oral Argument\\n\\nThe court has rules
      about oral argument and the parties are expected to follow the rules.\\nHere\u2019s
      a step-by-step guide on WHAT TO DO THE DAY OF ORAL ARGUMENT.\\nHere are some
      keys to making a successful oral argument:\\nBE PREPARED\\n\\nBring an outline
      of your key points and look at it when you need to. \\n passage B: Snow and
      ice can damage electric and natural gas meters, natural gas pipes and natural
      gas regulators, so never bury any of this equipment when shoveling, using a
      snowblower or plowing.\\nWhen removing snow or ice from a roof, never let it
      fall on electric or natural gas meters or related equipment.\\nClear dryer vents
      of snow. If blocked it can cause fires. Furnace vents should also be cleared
      to prevent carbon monoxide backing up.\\nNatural gas appliance chimneys and

      are a smart and helpful AI assistant with in-depth knowledge about how people
      search for information using search engines. In this task, you are given two
      passages, and a query, your job is to judge which passage is relatively more
      suitable to answer that query. The first passage will start with \\\"passage
      A\\\" and the second passage with start with \\\"passage B\\\". Output the preferred
      passage index, i.e. A or B and followed by an explanation, if none of the passage
      answer the query directly, pick the one that has more relevant information.\\n\\n
      passage A: Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in
      mind that the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The
      justices understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some
      people are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know
      that the justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak,
      the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs.
      Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may
      not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. Remember that
      oral argument is one small part of the whole appeal process. So while it can
      help your case, it is not the most important of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does
      my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will
      present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are
      not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a
      transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case?   All oral arguments
      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you
      want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription
      service and pay them a separate fee.\\n  \\n  What does the court think if I
      do not make an oral argument?   If you decide not to make an oral argument,
      the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t
      care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief.
      The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If
      you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the
      court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How will the court decide if there are no
      oral arguments?   If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.

      \ Why do I have to tell the court in advance if I want to make an oral argument?
      \  The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n

      passage A: EPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended
      mission which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved
      flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately
      700 km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning
      images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh)
      investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars
      with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and
      in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase
      of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The
      spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley
      2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations
      of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on
      4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of
      roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156
      AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution
      at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are
      known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet
      Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications
      could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that
      the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total
      cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\\n\\nComet Tempel 1\\n\\nComet
      9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has
      a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun
      to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the
      orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for
      at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and
      4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter.

      2024\\n\\nDeep Impact/EPOXINSSDCA/COSPAR ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe goals
      of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch
      a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta, much
      of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater
      formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly
      the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to:
      improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and
      directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the
      surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the
      crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers
      of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by
      comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and
      improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during
      encounter. \\n passage B: 2.\\nHow do I report problems such as dirty water
      or a water leak in the street?\\n\\nBetween 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 pm. please call
      626-307-1320. After hours please contact the Monterey Park Police Department
      at 626-573-1311. \_You will be able to speak to someone 24 hours a day. \\n\\n3.\\nWhat
      is our source of water?\\n\\r\\nThe City of Monterey Park Water System receives
      its water supply from one source - local groundwater. The water is produced
      by 12 City-owned wells with a total capacity of 20 million gallons per day (mgd).
      The wells reach a depth of up to 1,800 feet and are located in the vicinity
      of the Rio Hondo, which is outside the city limits and in the Main San Gabriel
      groundwater basin. Water from our deep wells is of excellent quality and requires
      little or no treatment. The Monterey Park Water System supplies an average of
      10 mgd to its customers.On average, about 65% of the water used each year is
      supplied from local rainfall; the other 35% is imported from northern California
      and then percolated into the groundwater aquifers. The water is imported for
      us by the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a public agency, and
      of which the City of Monterey Park is a member.\\t\\n\\n4.\\nHow much water
      does the Monterey Park community use?\\n\\r\\nUsage ranges from an average low
      of 7.3 million gallons per day (mgd) in February to an average high of 12 mgd
      in August. Average use per person is 100-110 gallons per day.\\t\\n\\n5.\\nWhat
      is ground water?\\n\\r\\nContrary to what a lot of people think, groundwater
      is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills
      the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments that lie beneath the surface
      of the earth, much the way water fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge
      or towel. \\t\\n\\n6.\\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\\n\\r\\nThe
      San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground
      reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel
      Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \\\"spreading basins\\\".
      Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such
      as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of
      the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater.

      Oral Argument\\n\\nThe court has rules about oral argument and the parties are
      expected to follow the rules.\\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide on WHAT TO

      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of their oral argument recording from the court. If a party wants

      \ Why do I have to tell the court in advance if I want to make an oral argument?
      \  The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n
      \ What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want to make
      an oral argument? \\n passage B: The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing
      thousands of cases every year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair
      and efficient. One rule is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument
      when they know people want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for
      oral argument in every case but few people showed up, the justices would lose
      valuable time that they could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions.
      That would slow down every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole
      court system.\\n  \\n  What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but
      I still want to make an oral argument?   If you do not tell the Court of Appeal
      that you want to make an oral argument, the court will assume you do not want
      to participate. If this happens you will lose your chance to have oral argument
      unless the other side requests oral argument. If the other side requests oral
      argument and you do not, you may still participate in oral argument if you filed
      a brief.\\nIf you want to make an oral argument, the only way to guarantee you
      have the opportunity is to respond by the deadline in the court\u2019s notice
      and go to the court on the day of oral argument for your case. There are no
      exceptions and no extensions for more time. After the time for oral argument
      passes, the court moves on to make a decision on your appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I
      talk about what\u2019s in my brief or not?   Yes, you can talk about things
      that are in your brief. But you should not read directly from the brief. Instead
      you should tell the justices what you think is the most important part of the
      appeal. You can explain more about what you want them to think about most in
      your brief. It is a mistake to spend the short time you have for oral argument
      saying the exact same thing that the justices have already read in your brief.\\n
      \ \\n  Will it affect the court\u2019s decision if I get nervous or I can\u2019t
      answer all the questions?   Many people feel nervous before and during oral
      argument. Keep in mind that the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments
      all the time. The justices understand that making an oral argument can be difficult
      and that some people are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou
      should know that the justices will be very prepared for your oral argument.
      Before you speak, the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read
      all the briefs. Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand
      that you may not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument.

      \ Why do I have to tell the court in advance if I want to make an oral argument?
      \  The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n
      \ What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want to make
      an oral argument? \\n passage B: The court will send all parties at least 20
      days advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost
      of Presenting an Oral Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an
      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision
      than the briefs or the record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose
      to make an oral argument or choose to waive (give up) oral argument.\\nReasons
      to make an oral argument\\n\\nto explain something in a brief\\nto talk about
      an argument in any party\u2019s brief\\nto highlight the most important issues
      in the appeal\\nto give the justices a chance to ask questions\\nto talk about
      new legal authorities that support an argument in a brief\\n\\nReasons not to
      make an oral argument\\n\\nthere is nothing new or different to say about what\u2019s
      already in a brief\\nthe arguments and issues are fully explained in a brief\\na
      party does not want to take questions from the justices\\na party wants to talk
      about a new legal issue or new evidence (this is not permitted in oral argument)\\n\\nHere
      are some important things to know when making a decision about whether or not
      to request oral argument:\\n\\nIf a party chooses not to make an oral argument,
      it does not impact what the court thinks about that party or their argument
      in the appeal.\\n\\nNot all parties have to do the same thing. So if only one
      party wants to make an oral argument, the court will have oral argument for
      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster
      if there is no oral argument, and the court will not take longer to make a decision
      if there is oral argument.\\n\\nMaking an oral argument may or may not help
      a party\u2019s side of the appeal. There is no way to know in advance. \\n             query:

      passage A: Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in
      mind that the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The
      justices understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some
      people are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know
      that the justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak,
      the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs.
      Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may
      not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. Remember that
      oral argument is one small part of the whole appeal process. So while it can
      help your case, it is not the most important of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does
      my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will
      present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are
      not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a
      transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case?   All oral arguments
      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you
      want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription
      service and pay them a separate fee.\\n  \\n  What does the court think if I
      do not make an oral argument?   If you decide not to make an oral argument,
      the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t
      care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief.
      The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If
      you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the
      court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How will the court decide if there are no
      oral arguments?   If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.

      2024\\n\\nDeep Impact/EPOXINSSDCA/COSPAR ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe goals
      of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch
      a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta, much
      of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater
      formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly
      the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to:
      improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and
      directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the
      surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the
      crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers
      of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by
      comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and
      improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during
      encounter. \\n passage B: The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands
      of cases every year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient.
      One rule is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know
      people want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument
      in every case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time
      that they could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would
      slow down every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n
      \ \\n  What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want
      to make an oral argument?   If you do not tell the Court of Appeal that you
      want to make an oral argument, the court will assume you do not want to participate.
      If this happens you will lose your chance to have oral argument unless the other
      side requests oral argument. If the other side requests oral argument and you
      do not, you may still participate in oral argument if you filed a brief.\\nIf
      you want to make an oral argument, the only way to guarantee you have the opportunity
      is to respond by the deadline in the court\u2019s notice and go to the court
      on the day of oral argument for your case. There are no exceptions and no extensions
      for more time. After the time for oral argument passes, the court moves on to
      make a decision on your appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I talk about what\u2019s in my
      brief or not?   Yes, you can talk about things that are in your brief. But you
      should not read directly from the brief. Instead you should tell the justices
      what you think is the most important part of the appeal. You can explain more
      about what you want them to think about most in your brief. It is a mistake
      to spend the short time you have for oral argument saying the exact same thing
      that the justices have already read in your brief.\\n  \\n  Will it affect the
      court\u2019s decision if I get nervous or I can\u2019t answer all the questions?
      \  Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in mind that

      \ Why do I have to tell the court in advance if I want to make an oral argument?
      \  The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n
      \ What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want to make
      an oral argument? \\n passage B: \\nOral Argument - California Appellate Courts\\n
      \\nOral Argument \\n8.\_Oral Argument\\nOral argument is the last step in the
      appeal process before the Court of Appeal makes a decision.\\nDuring oral argument,
      all parties who filed a brief are offered a limited amount of time to speak
      directly to the Court of Appeal justices before they decide the appeal.\\nOral
      argument is an opportunity for the parties to make sure the court understands
      the most important issues of an appeal. The parties can explain the arguments
      in their briefs and answer questions from the justices.\\nHere\u2019s an overview
      of what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an oral
      argument.\\nYou can also review these step-by-step guides on how to prepare
      for oral argument and what to do the day of oral argument.\\nWho Can Make an
      Oral Argument\\n\\nAny party \u2013 appellant or respondent \u2013 who filed
      a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal is eligible to make an oral
      argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief, then he or she cannot make
      an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter all the briefs are filed
      or the time to file them has passed, the Court of Appeal contacts each eligible
      party in the case about oral argument.\\nThe Court of Appeal sends notice to
      ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument. Sometimes the
      notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does not.\\nWhen the
      court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want to make an oral
      argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the deadline given
      in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the court will have
      oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties at least 20 days
      advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost

      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision

      2024\\n\\nDeep Impact/EPOXINSSDCA/COSPAR ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe goals
      of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch
      a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta, much
      of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater
      formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly
      the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to:
      improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and
      directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the
      surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the
      crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers
      of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by
      comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and
      improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during

      is nothing new or different to say about what\u2019s already in a brief\\nthe
      arguments and issues are fully explained in a brief\\na party does not want
      to take questions from the justices\\na party wants to talk about a new legal
      issue or new evidence (this is not permitted in oral argument)\\n\\nHere are
      some important things to know when making a decision about whether or not to
      request oral argument:\\n\\nIf a party chooses not to make an oral argument,
      it does not impact what the court thinks about that party or their argument
      in the appeal.\\n\\nNot all parties have to do the same thing. So if only one
      party wants to make an oral argument, the court will have oral argument for
      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster

      Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an oral argument.\_\\nDeciding
      Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases oral argument is optional,

      it does not impact what the court thinks about that party or their argument

      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster

      B: EPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended mission
      which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved
      flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately
      700 km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning
      images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh)
      investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars
      with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and
      in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase
      of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The
      spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley
      2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations
      of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on
      4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of
      roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156
      AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution
      at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are
      known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet
      Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications
      could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that
      the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total
      cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\\n\\nComet Tempel 1\\n\\nComet
      9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has
      a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun
      to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the
      orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for
      at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and
      4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter.

      passage A: Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in
      mind that the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The
      justices understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some
      people are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know
      that the justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak,
      the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs.
      Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may
      not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. Remember that
      oral argument is one small part of the whole appeal process. So while it can
      help your case, it is not the most important of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does
      my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will
      present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are
      not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a
      transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case?   All oral arguments
      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you
      want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription
      service and pay them a separate fee.\\n  \\n  What does the court think if I
      do not make an oral argument?   If you decide not to make an oral argument,
      the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t
      care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief.
      The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If
      you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the
      court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How will the court decide if there are no
      oral arguments?   If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.

      \\n8.\_Oral Argument\\nOral argument is the last step in the appeal process
      before the Court of Appeal makes a decision.\\nDuring oral argument, all parties
      who filed a brief are offered a limited amount of time to speak directly to
      the Court of Appeal justices before they decide the appeal.\\nOral argument
      is an opportunity for the parties to make sure the court understands the most
      important issues of an appeal. The parties can explain the arguments in their
      briefs and answer questions from the justices.\\nHere\u2019s an overview of
      what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an oral
      argument.\\nYou can also review these step-by-step guides on how to prepare
      for oral argument and what to do the day of oral argument.\\nWho Can Make an
      Oral Argument\\n\\nAny party \u2013 appellant or respondent \u2013 who filed
      a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal is eligible to make an oral
      argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief, then he or she cannot make
      an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter all the briefs are filed
      or the time to file them has passed, the Court of Appeal contacts each eligible
      party in the case about oral argument.\\nThe Court of Appeal sends notice to
      ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument. Sometimes the
      notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does not.\\nWhen the
      court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want to make an oral
      argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the deadline given
      in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the court will have
      oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties at least 20 days
      advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost
      of Presenting an Oral Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an
      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision
      than the briefs or the record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose
      to make an oral argument or choose to waive (give up) oral argument. \\n passage
      B: The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n
      \ What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want to make
      an oral argument?   If you do not tell the Court of Appeal that you want to
      make an oral argument, the court will assume you do not want to participate.
      If this happens you will lose your chance to have oral argument unless the other
      side requests oral argument. If the other side requests oral argument and you
      do not, you may still participate in oral argument if you filed a brief.\\nIf
      you want to make an oral argument, the only way to guarantee you have the opportunity
      is to respond by the deadline in the court\u2019s notice and go to the court
      on the day of oral argument for your case. There are no exceptions and no extensions
      for more time. After the time for oral argument passes, the court moves on to
      make a decision on your appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I talk about what\u2019s in my
      brief or not?   Yes, you can talk about things that are in your brief. But you
      should not read directly from the brief. Instead you should tell the justices
      what you think is the most important part of the appeal. You can explain more
      about what you want them to think about most in your brief. It is a mistake
      to spend the short time you have for oral argument saying the exact same thing
      that the justices have already read in your brief.\\n  \\n  Will it affect the
      court\u2019s decision if I get nervous or I can\u2019t answer all the questions?
      \  Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in mind that
      the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The justices
      understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some people
      are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know that the
      justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak, the
      justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs. Even
      though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may not
      have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. \\n             query:

      2024\\n\\nDeep Impact/EPOXINSSDCA/COSPAR ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe goals
      of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch
      a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta, much
      of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater
      formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly
      the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to:
      improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and
      directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the
      surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the
      crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers
      of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by
      comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and
      improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during
      encounter. \\n passage B: \\nOral Argument - California Appellate Courts\\n
      \\nOral Argument \\n8.\_Oral Argument\\nOral argument is the last step in the
      appeal process before the Court of Appeal makes a decision.\\nDuring oral argument,
      all parties who filed a brief are offered a limited amount of time to speak
      directly to the Court of Appeal justices before they decide the appeal.\\nOral
      argument is an opportunity for the parties to make sure the court understands
      the most important issues of an appeal. The parties can explain the arguments
      in their briefs and answer questions from the justices.\\nHere\u2019s an overview
      of what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an oral
      argument.\\nYou can also review these step-by-step guides on how to prepare
      for oral argument and what to do the day of oral argument.\\nWho Can Make an
      Oral Argument\\n\\nAny party \u2013 appellant or respondent \u2013 who filed
      a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal is eligible to make an oral
      argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief, then he or she cannot make
      an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter all the briefs are filed
      or the time to file them has passed, the Court of Appeal contacts each eligible
      party in the case about oral argument.\\nThe Court of Appeal sends notice to
      ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument. Sometimes the
      notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does not.\\nWhen the
      court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want to make an oral
      argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the deadline given
      in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the court will have
      oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties at least 20 days
      advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost
      of Presenting an Oral Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an
      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision
      than the briefs or the record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose
      to make an oral argument or choose to waive (give up) oral argument. \\n             query:

      Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended mission which has two
      parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved flying by comet
      103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately 700
      km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning
      images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh)
      investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars
      with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and
      in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase
      of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The
      spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley
      2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations
      of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on
      4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of
      roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156
      AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution
      at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are
      known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet
      Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications
      could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that
      the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total
      cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\\n\\nComet Tempel 1\\n\\nComet
      9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has
      a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun
      to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the
      orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for
      at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and
      4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter.

      Keep in mind this also includes questions from the justices.\\nIf a party has
      a lawyer, then the lawyer will talk in oral argument.\_\_\\nWhat to expect from
      the justices\\nThe Court of Appeal justices do many of the same things the parties
      do to prepare for oral argument. The justices fully review the record on appeal,
      so they know what happened in the trial court. The justices also read all the
      briefs and research the legal authorities, so they know about the legal issues
      in the appeal. During oral argument the justices will listen to the parties
      and they may ask questions.\\nThe Day of Oral Argument\\n\\nThe court has rules
      about oral argument and the parties are expected to follow the rules.\\nHere\u2019s
      a step-by-step guide on WHAT TO DO THE DAY OF ORAL ARGUMENT.\\nHere are some
      keys to making a successful oral argument:\\nBE PREPARED\\n\\nBring an outline
      of your key points and look at it when you need to. \\n passage B: Many people
      feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in mind that the Court of
      Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The justices understand that
      making an oral argument can be difficult and that some people are more comfortable
      speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know that the justices will be very
      prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak, the justices will have reviewed
      the record on appeal and read all the briefs. Even though they may ask you questions,
      the justices understand that you may not have all the answers.\\nJust do your
      best in oral argument. Remember that oral argument is one small part of the
      whole appeal process. So while it can help your case, it is not the most important
      of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have
      a lawyer, then the lawyer will present your oral argument. You can go to court
      for oral argument but you are not required to go if you are represented by a
      lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a transcript of what was said in the oral argument
      for my case?   All oral arguments in the Court of Appeal are electronically
      recorded. Any party may pay a fee to get a copy of the oral argument recording
      from the Court of Appeal. If you want a written transcript of the recording,
      you will need to contact a transcription service and pay them a separate fee.\\n
      \ \\n  What does the court think if I do not make an oral argument?   If you
      decide not to make an oral argument, the court will not think that you are not
      interested or that you don\u2019t care about the appeal. You do not give up
      or weaken any arguments in your brief. The court will not think differently
      or badly about you or your arguments. If you do not make an oral argument, it
      will not negatively impact the way the court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How
      will the court decide if there are no oral arguments?   If all the parties waive
      oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties talk to the justices in person \u2013
      then the Court of Appeal will decide your appeal based on the briefs, the  law,
      and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What does it mean if the court sends me a
      notice saying they don\u2019t need oral argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal
      will send notice to the parties saying the court is prepared to issue a decision
      without oral argument. This is not a sign that the court will decide either
      for or against the appeal.\\nEven though the court says oral argument is not
      necessary, you can still request oral argument. \\n             query: I need
      to do some legal research to be prepared for my oral argument. Can I visit the
      law library?\\n preferred passage: <|end_of_text|>\\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>\",\"max_tokens\":4096,\"temperature\":0.0}"

      ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe goals of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous
      with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations
      were made of the ejecta, much of which represented pristine material from the
      interior of the comet, the crater formation process, the resulting crater, and
      outgassing from the nucleus, particularly the newly exposed surface. The scientific
      objectives of the mission are to: improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics
      of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine
      properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition
      from the crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface
      layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior
      by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact;
      and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during
      encounter. \\n             query: I need to do some legal research to be prepared

      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster
      if there is no oral argument, and the court will not take longer to make a decision
      if there is oral argument.\\n\\nMaking an oral argument may or may not help

      passage A: Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in
      mind that the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The
      justices understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some
      people are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know
      that the justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak,
      the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs.
      Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may
      not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. Remember that
      oral argument is one small part of the whole appeal process. So while it can
      help your case, it is not the most important of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does
      my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will
      present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are
      not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a
      transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case?   All oral arguments
      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you
      want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription
      service and pay them a separate fee.\\n  \\n  What does the court think if I
      do not make an oral argument?   If you decide not to make an oral argument,
      the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t
      care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief.
      The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If
      you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the
      court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How will the court decide if there are no
      oral arguments?   If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.

      2024\\n\\nDeep Impact/EPOXINSSDCA/COSPAR ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe goals
      of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch
      a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta, much
      of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater
      formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly
      the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to:
      improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and
      directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the
      surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the
      crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers
      of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by
      comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and
      improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during
      encounter. \\n             query: I need to do some legal research to be prepared

      the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost of Presenting an Oral
      Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an oral argument.\_\\nDeciding
      Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases oral argument is optional,
      and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases oral argument can be helpful,
      but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision than the briefs or the
      record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose to make an oral argument
      or choose to waive (give up) oral argument.\\nReasons to make an oral argument\\n\\nto
      explain something in a brief\\nto talk about an argument in any party\u2019s
      brief\\nto highlight the most important issues in the appeal\\nto give the justices
      a chance to ask questions\\nto talk about new legal authorities that support
      an argument in a brief\\n\\nReasons not to make an oral argument\\n\\nthere
      is nothing new or different to say about what\u2019s already in a brief\\nthe
      arguments and issues are fully explained in a brief\\na party does not want
      to take questions from the justices\\na party wants to talk about a new legal
      issue or new evidence (this is not permitted in oral argument)\\n\\nHere are
      some important things to know when making a decision about whether or not to
      request oral argument:\\n\\nIf a party chooses not to make an oral argument,
      it does not impact what the court thinks about that party or their argument
      in the appeal.\\n\\nNot all parties have to do the same thing. So if only one
      party wants to make an oral argument, the court will have oral argument for
      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster
      if there is no oral argument, and the court will not take longer to make a decision
      if there is oral argument.\\n\\nMaking an oral argument may or may not help
      a party\u2019s side of the appeal. There is no way to know in advance. \\n passage
      B: The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n
      \ What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want to make
      an oral argument?   If you do not tell the Court of Appeal that you want to
      make an oral argument, the court will assume you do not want to participate.
      If this happens you will lose your chance to have oral argument unless the other
      side requests oral argument. If the other side requests oral argument and you
      do not, you may still participate in oral argument if you filed a brief.\\nIf
      you want to make an oral argument, the only way to guarantee you have the opportunity
      is to respond by the deadline in the court\u2019s notice and go to the court
      on the day of oral argument for your case. There are no exceptions and no extensions
      for more time. After the time for oral argument passes, the court moves on to
      make a decision on your appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I talk about what\u2019s in my
      brief or not?   Yes, you can talk about things that are in your brief. But you
      should not read directly from the brief. Instead you should tell the justices
      what you think is the most important part of the appeal. You can explain more
      about what you want them to think about most in your brief. It is a mistake
      to spend the short time you have for oral argument saying the exact same thing
      that the justices have already read in your brief.\\n  \\n  Will it affect the

      passage A: EPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended
      mission which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved
      flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately
      700 km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning
      images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh)
      investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars
      with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and
      in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase
      of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The
      spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley
      2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations
      of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on
      4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of
      roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156
      AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution
      at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are
      known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet
      Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications
      could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that
      the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total
      cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\\n\\nComet Tempel 1\\n\\nComet
      9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has
      a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun
      to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the
      orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for
      at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and
      4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter.

      \ Why do I have to tell the court in advance if I want to make an oral argument?
      \  The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every
      year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule
      is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know people
      want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument in every
      case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time that they
      could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would slow down
      every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n
      \ What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want to make
      an oral argument? \\n passage B: EPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has
      been funded for an extended mission which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended
      Investigation (DIXI) involved flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010
      at a closest approach of approximately 700 km. (The original target was comet
      Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning images and data. The Extrasolar Planet
      Observation and Characterization (EPOCh) investigation used the Deep Impact
      imaging system to observe nearby bright stars with known large planets to characterize
      the planets as they orbit behind and in front of the stars and to search other
      planets in those systems. This phase of the mission began 26 January 2008 and
      continued until the end of July. The spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon
      flybys to target itself for Hartley 2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008,
      and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations of the Earth and Moon were made. The
      encounter with Hartley 2 took place on 4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00
      UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet
      were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156 AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase
      angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution at closest approach was 7 m per pixel.
      The two extended missions together are known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2,
      remote observations were made of Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012
      S1). After a period in which communications could not be established in 2013,
      it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that the spacecraft was lost, and end
      of mission was announced on 19 September. Total cost of the extended mission
      is $40 million.\\n\\nComet Tempel 1\\n\\nComet 9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet
      which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical
      units (AU, the distance from the Sun to the Earth) and a perihelion distance
      of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is
      inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic. The orbit has changed in the past but
      the perihelion has been within 10 AU for at least 300,000 years. The nucleus
      is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and 4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on
      5 July 2005, the day after the encounter. \\n             query: I need to do

      passage A: Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in
      mind that the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The
      justices understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some
      people are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know
      that the justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak,
      the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs.
      Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may
      not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. Remember that
      oral argument is one small part of the whole appeal process. So while it can
      help your case, it is not the most important of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does
      my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will
      present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are
      not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a
      transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case?   All oral arguments
      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you
      want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription
      service and pay them a separate fee.\\n  \\n  What does the court think if I
      do not make an oral argument?   If you decide not to make an oral argument,
      the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t
      care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief.
      The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If
      you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the
      court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How will the court decide if there are no
      oral arguments?   If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.

      \\n8.\_Oral Argument\\nOral argument is the last step in the appeal process
      before the Court of Appeal makes a decision.\\nDuring oral argument, all parties
      who filed a brief are offered a limited amount of time to speak directly to
      the Court of Appeal justices before they decide the appeal.\\nOral argument
      is an opportunity for the parties to make sure the court understands the most
      important issues of an appeal. The parties can explain the arguments in their
      briefs and answer questions from the justices.\\nHere\u2019s an overview of
      what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an oral
      argument.\\nYou can also review these step-by-step guides on how to prepare
      for oral argument and what to do the day of oral argument.\\nWho Can Make an
      Oral Argument\\n\\nAny party \u2013 appellant or respondent \u2013 who filed
      a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal is eligible to make an oral
      argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief, then he or she cannot make
      an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter all the briefs are filed
      or the time to file them has passed, the Court of Appeal contacts each eligible
      party in the case about oral argument.\\nThe Court of Appeal sends notice to
      ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument. Sometimes the
      notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does not.\\nWhen the
      court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want to make an oral
      argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the deadline given
      in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the court will have
      oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties at least 20 days
      advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost
      of Presenting an Oral Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an
      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision

      2024\\n\\nDeep Impact/EPOXINSSDCA/COSPAR ID:\_2005-001ADescriptionThe goals
      of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch
      a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta, much
      of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater
      formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly
      the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to:
      improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and
      directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the
      surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the
      crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers
      of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by
      comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and
      improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly
      their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This
      project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary
      mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated
      EPOXI.\\n\\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\\n\\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370
      kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft
      is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple
      debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach.
      Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument,
      each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which
      will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed
      to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera
      has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at
      700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution
      camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.
      The infrared spectrometers cover the range from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometers with
      FOV of 0.29 degrees (hi-res) and 1.45 degrees (lo-res). The total flyby bus
      instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during
      encounter. \\n passage B: EPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has been funded

      with Hartley 2 took place on 4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00
      a.m. EDT) at a distance of roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064
      AU from the Sun and 0.156 AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was
      86 degrees, MRI resolution at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended
      missions together are known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations
      were made of Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period
      in which communications could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on
      16 September 2013 that the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced
      on 19 September. Total cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\\n\\nComet

      passage index, i.e. A or B and followed by an explanation, if none of the passage

      passage A: Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in
      mind that the Court of Appeal justices hear oral arguments all the time. The
      justices understand that making an oral argument can be difficult and that some
      people are more comfortable speaking in court than others.\\nYou should know
      that the justices will be very prepared for your oral argument. Before you speak,
      the justices will have reviewed the record on appeal and read all the briefs.
      Even though they may ask you questions, the justices understand that you may
      not have all the answers.\\nJust do your best in oral argument. Remember that
      oral argument is one small part of the whole appeal process. So while it can
      help your case, it is not the most important of an appeal.\\n  \\n  What does
      my lawyer do in oral argument?   If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will
      present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are
      not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\\n  \\n  Can I get a
      transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case?   All oral arguments
      in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee
      to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you
      want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription
      service and pay them a separate fee.\\n  \\n  What does the court think if I
      do not make an oral argument?   If you decide not to make an oral argument,
      the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t
      care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief.
      The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If
      you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the
      court decides an appeal.\\n  \\n  How will the court decide if there are no
      oral arguments?   If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties
      talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your
      appeal based on the briefs, the  law, and the record on appeal.\\n  \\n  What
      does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral
      argument?   Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying
      the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not
      a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\\nEven though
      the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.
      \\n passage B: The California Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of
      cases every year. There are rules to keep the appeal process fair and efficient.
      One rule is that the courts only schedule time for oral argument when they know
      people want to participate.\\nIf the court scheduled time for oral argument
      in every case but few people showed up, the justices would lose valuable time
      that they could have spent reviewing appeals and making decisions. That would
      slow down every appeal \u2013 including yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n
      \ \\n  What happens if I do not tell the court in advance, but I still want
      to make an oral argument?   If you do not tell the Court of Appeal that you
      want to make an oral argument, the court will assume you do not want to participate.
      If this happens you will lose your chance to have oral argument unless the other
      side requests oral argument. If the other side requests oral argument and you
      do not, you may still participate in oral argument if you filed a brief.\\nIf
      you want to make an oral argument, the only way to guarantee you have the opportunity
      is to respond by the deadline in the court\u2019s notice and go to the court
      on the day of oral argument for your case. There are no exceptions and no extensions
      for more time. After the time for oral argument passes, the court moves on to
      make a decision on your appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I talk about what\u2019s in my
      brief or not?   Yes, you can talk about things that are in your brief. But you
      should not read directly from the brief. Instead you should tell the justices
      what you think is the most important part of the appeal. You can explain more
      about what you want them to think about most in your brief. It is a mistake
      to spend the short time you have for oral argument saying the exact same thing
      that the justices have already read in your brief.\\n  \\n  Will it affect the
      court\u2019s decision if I get nervous or I can\u2019t answer all the questions?
      \  Many people feel nervous before and during oral argument. Keep in mind that

      passage A: EPOXI Extended Mission\\n\\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended
      mission which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved
      flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately
      700 km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning
      images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh)
      investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars
      with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and
      in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase
      of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The
      spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley
      2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations
      of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on
      4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of
      roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156
      AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution
      at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are
      known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet
      Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications
      could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that
      the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total
      cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\\n\\nComet Tempel 1\\n\\nComet
      9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has
      a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun
      to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the
      orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic.
      The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for
      at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and
      4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter.
      \\n passage B: \\nOral Argument - California Appellate Courts\\n \\nOral Argument
      \\n8.\_Oral Argument\\nOral argument is the last step in the appeal process
      before the Court of Appeal makes a decision.\\nDuring oral argument, all parties
      who filed a brief are offered a limited amount of time to speak directly to
      the Court of Appeal justices before they decide the appeal.\\nOral argument
      is an opportunity for the parties to make sure the court understands the most
      important issues of an appeal. The parties can explain the arguments in their
      briefs and answer questions from the justices.\\nHere\u2019s an overview of
      what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an oral
      argument.\\nYou can also review these step-by-step guides on how to prepare
      for oral argument and what to do the day of oral argument.\\nWho Can Make an
      Oral Argument\\n\\nAny party \u2013 appellant or respondent \u2013 who filed
      a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal is eligible to make an oral
      argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief, then he or she cannot make
      an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter all the briefs are filed
      or the time to file them has passed, the Court of Appeal contacts each eligible
      party in the case about oral argument.\\nThe Court of Appeal sends notice to
      ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument. Sometimes the
      notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does not.\\nWhen the
      court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want to make an oral
      argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the deadline given
      in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the court will have
      oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties at least 20 days
      advance notice including the date, time, and location of oral argument.\\nCost
      of Presenting an Oral Argument\\nThere is no additional court cost to make an
      oral argument.\_\\nDeciding Whether to Make an Oral Argument\\nIn most cases
      oral argument is optional, and it is a small part of an appeal.\\nIn some cases
      oral argument can be helpful, but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision

      but it is less important in the court\u2019s decision than the briefs or the
      record on appeal.\\nAn appellant or respondent can choose to make an oral argument
      or choose to waive (give up) oral argument.\\nReasons to make an oral argument\\n\\nto
      explain something in a brief\\nto talk about an argument in any party\u2019s
      brief\\nto highlight the most important issues in the appeal\\nto give the justices
      a chance to ask questions\\nto talk about new legal authorities that support
      an argument in a brief\\n\\nReasons not to make an oral argument\\n\\nthere
      is nothing new or different to say about what\u2019s already in a brief\\nthe
      arguments and issues are fully explained in a brief\\na party does not want
      to take questions from the justices\\na party wants to talk about a new legal
      issue or new evidence (this is not permitted in oral argument)\\n\\nHere are
      some important things to know when making a decision about whether or not to
      request oral argument:\\n\\nIf a party chooses not to make an oral argument,
      it does not impact what the court thinks about that party or their argument
      in the appeal.\\n\\nNot all parties have to do the same thing. So if only one
      party wants to make an oral argument, the court will have oral argument for
      the case but it will not make the other parties participate.\\n\\nIf a party
      has a lawyer, then the lawyer will present the oral argument. A party is not
      required to go to court for oral argument if he or she is represented by a lawyer.\\n\\nMany
      appeals do not have oral argument because all parties waive (give up) oral argument.
      When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal
      based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\\n\\nOral argument does not slow
      down or speed up the appeal process. So the court will not make a decision faster
      if there is no oral argument, and the court will not take longer to make a decision
      if there is oral argument.\\n\\nMaking an oral argument may or may not help
      a party\u2019s side of the appeal. There is no way to know in advance. \\n             query:

      Passage B directly addresses the query about visiting the law library for legal

      appeal process, they are not the only means of preparing for them. It also mentions
      that parties can choose to make an oral argument or waive it, and if they choose
      not to, it does not affect the court''s perception of their case. Furthermore,
      it highlights that legal research, including visiting the law library, is crucial
      for preparing for oral arguments. Passage A, on the other hand, focuses more
      on the role of a lawyer in oral arguments, the process of obtaining transcripts,
      and the court''s perspective on not making an oral argument. While both passages
      provide valuable information, Passage B is more directly relevant to the user''s

      much time to talk\\nThe court sends notice in advance to each party who is participating
      in oral argument. The notice says how much time the party will have to talk.

      the justices\\nThe Court of Appeal justices do many of the same things the parties
      do to prepare for oral argument. The justices fully review the record on appeal,
      so they know what happened in the trial court. The justices also read all the
      briefs and research the legal authorities, so they know about the legal issues

      a limited amount of time to speak directly to the Court of Appeal justices before
      they decide the appeal.\\nOral argument is an opportunity for the parties to

      or respondent \u2013 who filed a brief that was accepted by the Court of Appeal
      is eligible to make an oral argument.\\nIf the respondent did not file a brief,
      then he or she cannot make an oral argument.\_\\nTimeline of Oral Argument\\nAfter

      Appeal sends notice to ask the parties if they want to participate in oral argument.
      Sometimes the notice includes a date for oral argument and sometimes it does
      not.\\nWhen the court sends notice, each party must tell the court if they want
      to make an oral argument. A party must respond to the court in writing by the
      deadline given in the notice. If any party requests oral argument, then the
      court will have oral argument for the case.\\nThe court will send all parties

      guide on HOW TO PREPARE for oral argument.\\nWhat to talk about\\nHere are some
      general rules about what an appellant or respondent should and should not discuss

      what\u2019s in your brief word-for-word\\nrepeat or argue the facts of the case\\n\\nHow
      much time to talk\\nThe court sends notice in advance to each party who is participating
      in oral argument. The notice says how much time the party will have to talk.
      Generally each party has between 15 and 30 minutes to talk in oral argument.
      Keep in mind this also includes questions from the justices.\\nIf a party has
      a lawyer, then the lawyer will talk in oral argument.\_\_\\nWhat to expect from
      the justices\\nThe Court of Appeal justices do many of the same things the parties
      do to prepare for oral argument. The justices fully review the record on appeal,
      so they know what happened in the trial court. The justices also read all the
      briefs and research the legal authorities, so they know about the legal issues
      in the appeal. During oral argument the justices will listen to the parties
      and they may ask questions.\\nThe Day of Oral Argument\\n\\nThe court has rules
      about oral argument and the parties are expected to follow the rules.\\nHere\u2019s
      a step-by-step guide on WHAT TO DO THE DAY OF ORAL ARGUMENT.\\nHere are some
      keys to making a successful oral argument:\\nBE PREPARED\\n\\nBring an outline
      of your key points and look at it when you need to. \\n passage B: The California
      Courts of Appeal are busy hearing thousands of cases every year. There are rules
      to keep the appeal process fair and efficient. One rule is that the courts only
      schedule time for oral argument when they know people want to participate.\\nIf
      the court scheduled time for oral argument in every case but few people showed
      up, the justices would lose valuable time that they could have spent reviewing
      appeals and making decisions. That would slow down every appeal \u2013 including
      yours \u2013 in the whole court system.\\n  \\n  What happens if I do not tell
      the court in advance, but I still want to make an oral argument?   If you do
      not tell the Court of Appeal that you want to make an oral argument, the court
      will assume you do not want to participate. If this happens you will lose your
      chance to have oral argument unless the other side requests oral argument. If
      the other side requests oral argument and you do not, you may still participate
      in oral argument if you filed a brief.\\nIf you want to make an oral argument,
      the only way to guarantee you have the opportunity is to respond by the deadline
      in the court\u2019s notice and go to the court on the day of oral argument for
      your case. There are no exceptions and no extensions for more time. After the
      time for oral argument passes, the court moves on to make a decision on your
      appeal.\\n  \\n  Can I talk about what\u2019s in my brief or not?   Yes, you
      can talk about things that are in your brief. But you should not read directly
      from the brief. Instead you should tell the justices what you think is the most
      important part of the appeal. You can explain more about what you want them
      to think about most in your brief. It is a mistake to spend the short time you
      have for oral argument saying the exact same thing that the justices have already
      read in your brief.\\n  \\n  Will it affect the court\u2019s decision if I get
      nervous or I can\u2019t answer all the questions?   Many people feel nervous
      before and during oral argument. Keep in mind that the Court of Appeal justices
      hear oral arguments all the time. The justices understand that making an oral
      argument can be difficult and that some people are more comfortable speaking
      in court than others.\\nYou should know that the justices will be very prepared
      for your oral argument. Before you speak, the justices will have reviewed the
      record on appeal and read all the briefs. Even though they may ask you questions,
      the justices understand that you may not have all the answers.\\nJust do your
      best in oral argument. \\n             query: I need to do some legal research
      to be prepared for my oral argument. Can I visit the law library?\\n preferred

      passage: A\n\nExplanation: The passage A directly addresses the topic of preparing
      for an oral argument, which includes reviewing the record on appeal, briefs,

      what to talk about (focusing on legal issues, explaining arguments, and discussing
      new legal authorities) and how much time to talk (generally between 15 and 30

      information about the rules and procedures of oral arguments in the California
