        question is a fun twist on the classic tongue-twister and has become a popular
        joke due to its ambiguity. The answer, according to a humorous misunderstanding,
        is that a woodchuck (also known as a groundhog) could chuck approximately
        700 pounds of wood if it were a true woodchuck!\\n\\nHowever, the factual
        answer is quite different. A study by wildlife biologist Richard Thomas determined
        that a woodchuck could actually move about 300 lbs of soil when digging a
        burrow for its daily use \u2013 but no wood, not even at that rate. So, while
        we love the playful response, the literal answer is zero. Woodchucks primarily
        eat grass, leaves, and other plant material, not wood.\",\"index\":0,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":113,\"completion_tokens\":175,\"total_tokens\":288}}\n"
