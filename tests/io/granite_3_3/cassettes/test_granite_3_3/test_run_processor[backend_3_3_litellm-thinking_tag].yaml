        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate

        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices

        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES

        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        fact that no serious scientific study has been conducted to determine exactly
        how much wood this animal could chuck. The term \\\"woodchuck\\\" itself comes
        from an Algonquian word for \\\"burrower,\\\" suggesting a more burrowing
        or digging nature rather than wood-handling.\\n\\nHowever, if we were to play
        along with the joke:\\n\\n1. Firstly, consider the anatomy of a woodchuck.
        These animals have strong, clawed front paws that are excellent for digging
        and moving through soil, but they aren\u2019t particularly known for carrying
        or chucking heavy objects like logs.\\n\\n2. Woodchucks primarily eat vegetation,
        not specifically wood; their diet includes grasses, leaves, and roots. They
        have no specific behavior of collecting or \\\"chucking\\\" large pieces of
        wood as a significant part of their routine.\\n\\n3. To speculate, if we consider
        the average size of a log that a woodchuck might manage to move (assuming
        they could lift it), logs vary greatly in weight and size. A typical mature
        log might weigh anywhere from 50 to over 100 pounds depending on its species
        and condition.\\n\\n4. Given the physical constraints of a woodchuck\u2014their
        powerful but small front claws, not their hind legs for lifting or carrying\u2014the
        amount they could realistically \\\"chuck\\\" would be significantly limited
        by these factors.\\n\\n5. Moreover, if we were to assume an average capacity
        based on their digging prowess, a woodchuck might manage to move several small
        logs of around 30-40 pounds each, depending on the terrain and effort expended.\\n\\nIn
        conclusion, considering all aspects\u2014anatomy, behavior, and practical
        limitations\u2014the amount of wood a woodchuck could \\\"chuck\\\" is more
        a joke or an imaginative exercise than a quantifiable scientific fact.\\u003c/think\\u003e\\u003cresponse\\u003e###
        The Wood Chuck\u2019s Wood-Chucking Ability:\\n\\nThe phrase \\\"how much
        wood could a woodchuck chuck?\\\" is a playful tongue twister with no basis
        in factual science. Here's why it remains a humorous riddle rather than a
        quantifiable question:\\n\\n1. **Woodchuck Anatomy and Behavior**: Woodchucks
        are known for their burrowing abilities, not wood-gathering or heavy object
        manipulation. They have strong claws useful for digging but not for carrying
        large logs.\\n\\n2. **Dietary Habits**: Their diet primarily consists of vegetation,
        grasses, leaves, and roots. Wood is not a significant part of their diet,
        further reducing the likelihood they could \\\"chuck\\\" substantial amounts
        of wood.\\n\\n3. **Log Weights**: Even considering small logs, the average
        weight of a log a woodchuck might handle would be relatively limited\u2014typically
        around 30-40 pounds for typical logs, but much less than the phrasing implies
        due to anatomical constraints.\\n\\n4. **Practical Limitations**: A woodchuck's
        claws are more effective for moving soil and creating burrows rather than
        lifting or carrying heavy objects like logs, especially when considering their
        overall body weight (around 15-20 pounds).\\n\\n5. **Humorous Speculation**:
        If we were to hypothetically assume a woodchuck could manage something realistically,
        perhaps they might move several smaller logs of 30-40 pounds each depending
        on terrain and effort, but this is purely speculative due to the animal's
        natural behaviors.\\n\\nIn summary, while it\u2019s entertaining to consider
        the idea, there is no serious scientific basis for quantifying how much wood
        a woodchuck could chuck. It remains an amusing tongue twister and a test of
        creativity rather than a factual answer.\\u003c/response\\u003e\",\"done\":true,\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"context\":[49152,2946,49153,39558,390,17071,2821,44,30468,225,36,34,36,38,32,203,4282,884,8080,278,659,30,18909,810,25697,32,2448,884,312,17247,19551,47330,32,0,203,49152,496,49153,49152,2946,49153,39558,390,17071,2821,44,30468,225,36,34,36,38,32,203,23669,1182,2821,44,32868,225,35,41,30,225,36,34,36,39,32,203,4282,884,8080,278,659,30,18909,810,25697,32,2448,884,312,17247,19551,47330,32,203,33797,372,3638,1256,2467,328,312,44888,461,16360,3352,32,2448,883,2866,2835,1370,26103,461,5966,299,2164,2670,18641,2414,32,701,322,10889,2164,30,14707,381,328,312,44888,14770,432,9209,30,23943,1649,30,49100,30,316,31289,30,26158,30,1751,30000,30,461,13330,372,10227,4487,31,33711,318,19383,2164,32,701,322,1789,4169,30,4122,544,10297,20130,30,27514,993,30,461,26158,101,645,322,26103,4169,30,2664,20725,5024,322,1158,5295,688,844,409,405,3809,32,886,1789,1395,46053,322,10889,2164,32,5950,1370,26103,3733,333,16462,855,16462,48,461,2866,1370,1789,3733,333,1986,855,1986,48,436,2504,1256,2467,32,0,203,49152,496,49153,8257,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,663,7194,663,7194,49,0,203,49152,17594,49153,0,203,49152,17594,49153,46,16462,48,1318,23909,313,6893,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,380,7194,663,7194,20,438,600,3610,273,788,340,8206,19240,30,12270,1654,372,3860,539,556,18281,7024,810,24240,458,11911,43490,1399,8841,86,7000,2625,322,18804,432,312,41878,380,7194,32,399,41878,380,7194,30,2329,8967,619,312,16398,44770,30,438,312,23598,643,299,345,404,7904,7555,372,27957,29334,32,203,203,1318,21981,271,46138,328,322,8434,688,1289,31226,31722,14866,1401,2583,25650,318,372,9921,11114,2624,5610,41878,458,26261,3065,663,7194,32,886,5615,313,21118,380,7194,20,8015,12767,645,600,2752,7059,448,2531,3594,436,313,13787,643,265,2360,48350,312,1829,23598,643,299,556,7338,2563,24406,9283,2784,41878,31,26775,32,203,203,17046,30,415,996,4528,372,4654,7947,623,322,8725,479,44,478,35,32,8819,631,30,6295,322,600,4149,107,432,312,41878,380,7194,32,8204,26261,101,1159,12101,30,1532,812,318,8432,298,3955,688,884,39203,436,7338,2563,461,14089,3919,1259,335,30,1273,2953,15420,2735,102,27470,8967,436,18499,299,556,663,7194,299,32389,4684,2124,8821,32,478,36,32,624,4907,380,36546,37897,40808,5292,371,367,30,646,21473,41878,45,3623,2068,364,8600,2914,2515,30,26243,30,461,33032,32,11228,1159,1289,2818,5853,432,46360,556,313,380,7194,299,20,7622,23073,432,41878,619,312,14724,1742,432,3623,16111,32,478,37,32,2614,1374,6197,30,415,996,6295,322,10858,1334,432,312,1245,688,312,41878,380,7194,4796,11856,372,5169,308,350,17364,2953,3065,20021,561,471,8821,21187,39553,328,7533,461,1334,32,399,28531,345,1165,1245,4796,996,1799,24323,645,225,39,34,372,2288,225,35,34,34,298,1053,101,14714,544,2819,21791,461,3700,32,478,38,32,15273,322,14303,13383,432,312,41878,380,7194,7415,46555,27196,1273,5532,8432,1532,3955,30,646,3623,420,552,999,5360,436,456,33654,556,18499,299,7415,1382,5168,2953,3065,4011,5401,1247,313,380,7194,20,2268,526,32323,14943,810,3282,23851,32,478,39,32,12630,1498,30,415,996,4528,372,10014,600,10858,13802,4122,544,3623,7338,2563,534,105,503,30,312,41878,380,7194,4796,11856,372,5169,10204,5532,8821,432,6835,225,37,34,31,38,34,298,1053,101,2504,30,14714,544,322,37247,461,18419,538,22323,32,203,203,383,457,13715,30,31286,1169,30885,7415,278,4149,107,30,5853,30,461,37417,5183,7415,1382,5168,432,41878,312,41878,380,7194,3065,313,380,7194,20,438,1829,312,8725,479,556,600,17463,266,1353,22345,2784,312,13292,15621,31722,8434,1730,16462,772,1986,48,1482,886,624,4907,1884,7194,2735,101,624,4907,31,828,7194,299,40798,44,203,203,1318,23909,313,6893,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,380,7194,663,7194,12791,438,312,4654,2790,273,788,340,8206,19240,623,1289,14977,328,296,7975,27536,32,9540,1182,6916,561,25849,312,21981,271,3291,540,3422,9283,2784,312,13292,15621,7000,44,478,35,32,1115,73,4907,380,7194,2244,4149,107,461,19000,4914,624,4907,380,36546,884,8967,436,3623,23598,643,299,41863,30,646,41878,31,20646,299,556,32389,1300,38828,32,11228,1159,12101,1532,3955,6364,436,7338,2563,1273,646,436,18499,299,7622,8821,32,478,36,32,1115,2820,24848,677,360,1507,4914,886,476,2068,364,37897,21852,432,5292,371,367,30,2914,2515,30,26243,30,461,33032,32,624,4907,438,646,312,14724,1742,432,3623,2068,364,30,9686,45984,322,36313,2953,3065,313,380,7194,20,14226,31651,432,41878,32,478,37,32,1115,1335,2688,4753,4914,21984,31286,5532,8821,30,322,10858,7533,432,312,1245,312,41878,380,7194,4796,2887,2268,526,29858,14943,7415,13074,7637,6835,225,37,34,31,38,34,298,1053,101,436,28531,8821,30,1273,5610,6679,2784,322,2674,100,9949,34506,7254,372,600,4149,1578,13383,32,478,38,32,1115,31503,1578,16106,993,4914,399,41878,380,7194,1182,1532,3955,884,1829,19043,436,14089,1259,335,461,6892,23598,2138,9283,2784,456,33654,556,18499,299,32389,4684,2124,8821,30,17587,1412,31286,3623,18869,3361,7533,308,11279,225,35,39,31,36,34,298,1053,101,547,478,39,32,1115,31213,271,3291,6577,3899,4914,1670,996,4528,372,420,19107,10264,7637,10014,312,41878,380,719
